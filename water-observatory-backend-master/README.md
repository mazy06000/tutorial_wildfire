# Water Observatory Backend

This repository shows how the [BlueDot](https://www.blue-dot-observatory.com)'s Water Observatory is extracting surface water levels of waterbodies across the globe. The algorithm is described in more details [here](https://www.blue-dot-observatory.com/aboutwaterobservatory).

An [example Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/sentinel-hub/water-observatory-backend/blob/master/example/example-optical-water-level-extraction.ipynb) shows how to extract surface water level for a single dam on a specific date. The Bluedot's Water Observatory repeats this operation for all monitored waterbodies and for all available Sentinel-2 imagery and uploads the results to S3 which is used by the dashboard to display the results. 
The results are presented in [BlueDot Water Observatory Dashboard](https://water.blue-dot-observatory.com/38419). Frontend application is available 
in this [repository](https://github.com/sentinel-hub/water-observatory-frontend).
